They recently bought a house together and decided to get a dog. My \\\"friend\\\" told me that she wanted a \\\"cute\\\" breed of dog such as an English or French Bulldog, even after I told her about the health difficulties they face (I'm not saying these breeds are bad, but to say they are bred healthily would be a lie). In the end, they got a German Shepherd, since her boyfriend said that he had one when he was younger, and that it would also deter people from breaking into their house. I'd met this dog, and he is one of the most well behaved and kind dogs I've ever met. However, she was constantly complaining about him to me, saying that he was \\\"too much work.\\\" I told her that every new puppy owner feels this way, and that she'll feel better about him eventually, and that she'll be able to have a loyal companion for life.\\n\\nLast week, her boyfriend, who is a mutual friend of mine, calls me and asks if he'd seen their dog. Apparently, my \\\"friend\\\" had been walking him, when he apparently tore his leash off and ran away. I spoke to my friend later that day, and she told me that wasn't the case, and that she'd actually secretly sold the dog to another home, and that she was telling her boyfriend that so he wouldn't get upset. In her own mind, she seemed to believe it was ok, since it was a \\\"white lie.\\\" I told her that's she's evil for doing what she did, and immediately phoned her boyfriend. They both haven't spoken to me since.\\n\\nToday, I logged on to Instagram, to see a picture of her with an English Bulldog puppy, which infuriated me to say the least. I called one of my friends about this, who told me that I need to mind my own business, and that the German Shepherd was a \\\"piece of work anyway.\\\" She also told me that the way I spoke to her was awful, and that I tried to ruin her relationship.\\n\\nAITA for acting the way I did?\",\n          \"Me - 14F\\nBrother (Daniel) - 16M\\n\\nI used to live in City X, I was born and raised there. All my friends are here, all extracurricular opportunities I have are here (i.e. the debate circuit is very strong here, connections I\\u2019ve cultivated for youth activism, good internship opportunities), etc. But my brother fucked up big time about a year ago and ruined it all for us. \\n\\nI\\u2019m not going to go into the exact nature of what he did, but it was BAD. He didn\\u2019t do something that would have serious legal consequences or anything. But it was stupid, incredibly problematic, and got him landed in enough shit for it to get spread throughout social media. He also got in trouble with the school, and he claimed he couldn\\u2019t stay there because his reputation is ruined. Personally, I think he should\\u2019ve thought of that BEFORE HE DID IT. \\n\\nMy parents were mad, but they got sympathetic because he said he was getting bullied & they wanted to protect his future, so they moved him to 2 other high schools, but it ended in the same way because everyone knew what happened anyways. So my parents & him decided to move to an entirely different state, in City Y, without consulting me at all. \\n\\nMy brother\\u2019s future is important, but why should my future be sacrificed just because he fucked up? City Y is super small and has way shittier schools, and doesn\\u2019t have a debate league. I also had to leave all my friends behind. No one knows about what my brother did, so he\\u2019s happy, my parents are happy he\\u2019s happy. I\\u2019m the only one who\\u2019s not happy. At the risk of sounding cocky, I had a really good future in my extracurriculars. Like definitely could\\u2019ve shaped up to be one of the best nationally according to a lot of people, if I had the right coaching and competition. I could\\u2019ve gotten scholarships to great schools for it! But no Daniel had to get himself into deep shit, and drag me into it too. \\n\\nI\\u2019ve been here for 4 months now, and I didn\\u2019t talk to my brother at all for the first two months. Now we\\u2019re all at home, and my frustrations are building everytime I see him. So at dinner, my brother was talking about his college prospects with my parents, and I was just so frustrated that I snapped. Our conversation went like:\\n\\nHim: I think I have a good shot at getting into [state school]\\n\\nMe: Like hell you do, with the shit you did last year. If you think running away to a different city and ruining my life can make what you did go away, then you\\u2019re in for a fucking treat. \\n\\nHim: You\\u2019re such a fucking bitch, get over it already\\n\\nMom: donthateondebate, stop blaming your brother, you need to start adjusting to City Y, apologize for what you said. \\n\\nDad: [state school] won\\u2019t know\\n\\nMe: I\\u2019ll email every single college you apply to with the screenshots and evidence if we don\\u2019t move back to City X, thats a promise not a threat\\n\\nMy parents got really furious with me for that, but I\\u2019m not joking. AITA or my brother/parents?\",\n          \"AITAH for being mad at my parents for not putting me leaving for Bootcamp over my little brother going to a baseball tournament \\n\\nI decided in september 2023 that i was going to go to the navy after i graduate in May 2024. Around December my step mother(43) started talking about my little brother(13) had a tournament in Omaha in June. Well then dates fall around my ship date for boot camp. My little brother and i are very close and i\\u2019m very upset that i won\\u2019t get to see him the day i ship and he won\\u2019t get to see me swear in. Well i asked my step mom about this and she said that it doesn\\u2019t matter and that this tournament is more important than me shipping out to bootcamp halfway across the country. She even said that if he has a tournament the week that i graduate bootcamp or tech school that he won\\u2019t be allowed to attend either.

They recently bought a house together and decided to get a dog. My \\\"friend\\\" told me that she wanted a \\\"cute\\\" breed of dog such as an English or French Bulldog, even after I told her about the health difficulties they face (I'm not saying these breeds are bad, but to say they are bred healthily would be a lie). In the end, they got a German Shepherd, since her boyfriend said that he had one when he was younger, and that it would also deter people from breaking into their house. I'd met this dog, and he is one of the most well behaved and kind dogs I've ever met. However, she was constantly complaining about him to me, saying that he was \\\"too much work.\\\" I told her that every new puppy owner feels this way, and that she'll feel better about him eventually, and that she'll be able to have a loyal companion for life.\\n\\nLast week, her boyfriend, who is a mutual friend of mine, calls me and asks if he'd seen their dog. Apparently, my \\\"friend\\\" had been walking him, when he apparently tore his leash off and ran away. I spoke to my friend later that day, and she told me that wasn't the case, and that she'd actually secretly sold the dog to another home, and that she was telling her boyfriend that so he wouldn't get upset. In her own mind, she seemed to believe it was ok, since it was a \\\"white lie.\\\" I told her that's she's evil for doing what she did, and immediately phoned her boyfriend. They both haven't spoken to me since.\\n\\nToday, I logged on to Instagram, to see a picture of her with an English Bulldog puppy, which infuriated me to say the least. I called one of my friends about this, who told me that I need to mind my own business, and that the German Shepherd was a \\\"piece of work anyway.\\\" She also told me that the way I spoke to her was awful, and that I tried to ruin her relationship.\\n\\nAITA for acting the way I did?\",\n          \"Me - 14F\\nBrother (Daniel) - 16M\\n\\nI used to live in City X, I was born and raised there. All my friends are here, all extracurricular opportunities I have are here (i.e. the debate circuit is very strong here, connections I\\u2019ve cultivated for youth activism, good internship opportunities), etc. But my brother fucked up big time about a year ago and ruined it all for us. \\n\\nI\\u2019m not going to go into the exact nature of what he did, but it was BAD. He didn\\u2019t do something that would have serious legal consequences or anything. But it was stupid, incredibly problematic, and got him landed in enough shit for it to get spread throughout social media. He also got in trouble with the school, and he claimed he couldn\\u2019t stay there because his reputation is ruined. Personally, I think he should\\u2019ve thought of that BEFORE HE DID IT. \\n\\nMy parents were mad, but they got sympathetic because he said he was getting bullied & they wanted to protect his future, so they moved him to 2 other high schools, but it ended in the same way because everyone knew what happened anyways. So my parents & him decided to move to an entirely different state, in City Y, without consulting me at all. \\n\\nMy brother\\u2019s future is important, but why should my future be sacrificed just because he fucked up? City Y is super small and has way shittier schools, and doesn\\u2019t have a debate league. I also had to leave all my friends behind. No one knows about what my brother did, so he\\u2019s happy, my parents are happy he\\u2019s happy. I\\u2019m the only one who\\u2019s not happy. At the risk of sounding cocky, I had a really good future in my extracurriculars. Like definitely could\\u2019ve shaped up to be one of the best nationally according to a lot of people, if I had the right coaching and competition. I could\\u2019ve gotten scholarships to great schools for it! But no Daniel had to get himself into deep shit, and drag me into it too. \\n\\nI\\u2019ve been here for 4 months now, and I didn\\u2019t talk to my brother at all for the first two months. Now we\\u2019re all at home, and my frustrations are building everytime I see him. So at dinner, my brother was talking about his college prospects with my parents, and I was just so frustrated that I snapped. Our conversation went like:\\n\\nHim: I think I have a good shot at getting into [state school]\\n\\nMe: Like hell you do, with the shit you did last year. If you think running away to a different city and ruining my life can make what you did go away, then you\\u2019re in for a fucking treat. \\n\\nHim: You\\u2019re such a fucking bitch, get over it already\\n\\nMom: donthateondebate, stop blaming your brother, you need to start adjusting to City Y, apologize for what you said. \\n\\nDad: [state school] won\\u2019t know\\n\\nMe: I\\u2019ll email every single college you apply to with the screenshots and evidence if we don\\u2019t move back to City X, thats a promise not a threat\\n\\nMy parents got really furious with me for that, but I\\u2019m not joking. AITA or my brother/parents?\",\n          \"AITAH for being mad at my parents for not putting me leaving for Bootcamp over my little brother going to a baseball tournament \\n\\nI decided in september 2023 that i was going to go to the navy after i graduate in May 2024. Around December my step mother(43) started talking about my little brother(13) had a tournament in Omaha in June. Well then dates fall around my ship date for boot camp. My little brother and i are very close and i\\u2019m very upset that i won\\u2019t get to see him the day i ship and he won\\u2019t get to see me swear in. Well i asked my step mom about this and she said that it doesn\\u2019t matter and that this tournament is more important than me shipping out to bootcamp halfway across the country. She even said that if he has a tournament the week that i graduate bootcamp or tech school that he won\\u2019t be allowed to attend either.

The main difference between us is that Bob is very extroverted and is always meeting new people, while I have a very small friend group.\\n\\n\\r  \\nThis has never been an issue between us, when he\\u2019s out with friends I usually stay home and relax, but around the end of 2022 he\\u2019s been very pushy with the idea o me becoming part of his other friend group, I\\u2019ve met this guys before they seem great but I\\u2019m not looking for more friend or a bigger group to hang out with and have told this to Bob. He insists that we have a lot in common and would really like for me to be part of the gang, but I just can\\u2019t see it, I really like to just hang out with him alone like we used to.\\n\\n\\r  \\nI\\u2019m not a jealous friend and have never asked him to change plans if he already has them with his friend group, usually he invites me, I decline and no hard feelings.\\n\\n\\r  \\nLast week we were supposed to got to a concert just the two of us, but when I arrived at the place, I saw his hole friend group there, I was annoyed but kept it to myself, a few days later when talking about the concert, he said that he had a great time \\u201chaving all his friend there for once\\u201d, I just said it was ok but to not ambush me like that again, this caused a fight between us.\\n\\n\\r  \\nAnyway, I was sure I was right but when I told my GF she said I\\u2019m being stubborn by not even trying to get along with his friends and now here I am. Am I the asshole? \\r  \\n\",\n          \"So I only ever get together w him once maybe twice a week at most during the course of 2 to 6 and every time I\\u2019m met with complaints from my roommates because they\\u2019re always taking naps at this time. Idk whether to conceid and try and rent out a place to practice or do I just stand my ground cuz hienstly I just feel like it\\u2019s a normal time of the day where no one should be taking naps and if you do you shouldn\\u2019t expect others to shape their schedule around their 2 hour nap.\\n\\n I\\u2019ve never been asked to turn it down and I always made sure it was never deafening and that I was even able to still talk over it. They just say I need a new place to practice. Am I the asshole? I feel like I\\u2019m just tryna enjoy myself and I\\u2019m getting bitched at, idk, ik there\\u2019s somewhere we can compromise but I\\u2019m just unsure at where I stand personally. \",\n          \"I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a \\\"trip\\\" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. \\n\\nRecently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. \\n\\nI've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.\\n\\nI do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.\\n\\nStill, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.\\n\\nSo, AITA?\\n\\nEdit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister.

He insists that we have a lot in common and would really like for me to be part of the gang, but I just can\\u2019t see it, I really like to just hang out with him alone like we used to.\\n\\n\\r  \\nI\\u2019m not a jealous friend and have never asked him to change plans if he already has them with his friend group, usually he invites me, I decline and no hard feelings.\\n\\n\\r  \\nLast week we were supposed to got to a concert just the two of us, but when I arrived at the place, I saw his hole friend group there, I was annoyed but kept it to myself, a few days later when talking about the concert, he said that he had a great time \\u201chaving all his friend there for once\\u201d, I just said it was ok but to not ambush me like that again, this caused a fight between us.\\n\\n\\r  \\nAnyway, I was sure I was right but when I told my GF she said I\\u2019m being stubborn by not even trying to get along with his friends and now here I am.

Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. \\n\\nRecently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. \\n\\nI've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.\\n\\nI do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.\\n\\nStill, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.\\n\\nSo, AITA?\\n\\nEdit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist.
